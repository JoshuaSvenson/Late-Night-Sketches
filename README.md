# Late-Night-Sketches
This repository is a work in progress as I continue learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, etc. The repository is for a website whose purpose is to document sketches and games played on late night talk shows. Currently working on the game 'Box of Lies' as played by Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show on NBC.

To run website:

1. Download Late-Night-Sketches repository. Unzip the download folder.
2. Open html folder.
3. Right-click nbc-home.html and click Open to open site in your default browser.

Navigating the site:

1. Once site is opened, click on The Tonight Show link.
2. Click on link that says Box of Lies or the picture.
3. The Box of Lies page displays information about each guest Jimmy Fallon has played Box of Lies with. Scroll through each by clicking on the arrows to the left and right of the embedded video or click each guest's name on the left to jump directly to that person.

More guests will be added to Box of Lies in future updates, followed by more Tonight Show games, followed by games from more shows.
